# Kernel-PCA
Kernel methods are easy way to transform linear algorithm to non linear algorithm using the kernel matrix.
A simple implementation of kernel pca from scratch. 
The main disadvantage of kernel pca in packages is that we get the projected points directly and not the projected vector.
The main idea behind the hard coded implementation is to get a better understanding of how the kernel function behaves with the actual projection vectors.
